Next.js + Tailwind CSS Project

This GitHub repository showcases my first personal project â€“ a modern, aesthetically pleasing, and fully responsive insurance website developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. While the project is now complete and not open for contributions, it serves as a testament to my front-end development skills and commitment to creating visually appealing and user-friendly web experiences. Take a look at the codebase to see how I crafted this responsive design.
